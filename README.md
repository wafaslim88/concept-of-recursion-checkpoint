we will Test if a word is a palindrome. Palindrom is a sequence of letters that reads the same forward and backward.
so, our first base case is that a string with exactly zero letters or one letter is a palindrom by default.
then, if the string contains two or more letters,if the first and last letters are different so the string is not a palindrom and this is our second base case.
otherwise, if the first and last letters are the same here is where we will have our recursive case(we test the rest of the string).
